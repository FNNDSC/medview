Medview viewer is a distributed collaborative neuroimage visualization application that is
delivered to the users over the web without requiring the installation of any additional software
or browser plugging. This not only enhances accessibility and usability for the end-users but
automatically provides them with the latest application updates without requiring any technological
skills or administrator-level access to their computing devices.

The viewer can read a directory tree (chrome) or multiple neuroimage files in the same
directory (other browsers) for their visualization and collaboration through the embedded
[viewerjs.Viewer](https://github.com/FNNDSC/viewerjs) visualization object (VObj).
Alternatively users can directly drag in and drop files/folders onto the viewer.

Users can start a real-time collaboration session as the collaboration owner or alternatively
joint to an existing collaboration session by clicking the "Start collaboration" button. The
Googleâ€™s login and/or authorization windows will then pop up and after successful completion
they will be able to share visualization and collaborate in real-time.

Please take a look at the [viewerjs.Viewer's wiki](https://github.com/FNNDSC/viewerjs/wiki) to
learn how to interact with the embedded VObj through peripheral device controls.

A live version the web application is available here: <http://fnndsc.github.io/medview/>.
